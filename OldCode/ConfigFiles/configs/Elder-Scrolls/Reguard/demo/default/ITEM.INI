; 	Notes:
;	      -	The index number of the item, (eg. type[0]), is the ID number used in all script commands
;	      -	Item 0 is always used as the compass item. Giving the player this item will automatically turn on the
;		compass display.
;	      -	For objects that carry weapons, the ATTR_WEAPON attribute is the item id for it's weapon,
;		(default sheathed).
;	      -	Any item index's for hand-objects or weapons that are declared as 0 are taken to
;		mean no object or no hand-object, (as item 0 is always the compass - a special case).
;	      -	Any value of 0 or less in the script_instances field will be assumed to mean unlimited instances
;		of the use_script AI file.
;	      -	almost all fields are optional, any missing fields are assumed to be unused.

;	Tips:
;	      -	you may specify object and AI filenames as 8-character filenames without path or extension, (eg. as you
;		would enter a script name in BS-Edit).
;	      -	writing a field with nothing after the = sign is the same as missing out a field.

; general fields
;
;	type[x]				type of item:
;					   0 =	general item
;					   1 =	sword item, a weapon that can be drawn and sheathed and has both drawn and
;						sheathed 3D files
;					   2 =	hand object item is a special case for any object that may over-ride a
;						weapon, (ie. torch)
;	flags[x]			bit-field of misc flags, (add the following values together to set flags):
;					   1 =	remove this item whenever it is droped, (reguardless of player total)
;					   2 =	drop item after use
;					   4 =	remove item after use
;	hide[x]				when set to 1 the item is hidden and not displayed on screen or inventory, but still
;					exists and may be added, dropped, used etc. like a normal item, (note the player
;					can not select or use a hidden item, but a script may use the UseItem() function).
;	total[x]			total number of this item in the game
;	player_max[x]			the maximum number of this item the player can have
;	player_total[x]			the number of this item the player starts the game with
;	name[x]				short name RTX label
;	description[x]			longer item description RTX label
;
; use AI script fields
;
;	use_script[x]			AI script to execute when used, (through the shell system)
;	script_instances[x]		instances of AI scripts that may run. if you set this to 1 then no matter how many
;					times the player uses the item, if this AI file has not finished a new one will not
;					be ran, (for scripts that should only run a certain number of times), an instance of
;					2 will allow 2 scripts to run at once. A value of 0 is taken to mean 'infinate'.
;
; general game objects/bitmaps
;
;	bitmap[x]			bitmap index for in-game display. this is the bitmap number from the bitmap_file
;					above.
;	inventory_object_file[x]	3D object file used in the inventory screen
;	game_object_file[x]		3D object file used in the game
;
; drop and add lists
;
;	add_item_list[x]		list of items to pickup when this item is picked up
;	drop_add_item_list[x]		list of items to drop when this item is picked up
;	remove_drop_item_list[x]	list of items to remove when this item is dropped
;	required_item_list[x]		list of items the player must have before picking up this item
;	drop_use_item_list[x]		list of items to drop when this item is used
;
; weapon fields
;
;	hand_object_file[x]		3D object for hand object when in hand, (must be a weapon object for a weapon item
;					type). if the item type is general, then this is ignored.
;	hilt_object_file[x]		3D object for hand object when sheathed
