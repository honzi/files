// desync.cfg
//
// We've added a way for people to track desyncs in final release builds. 
// If the host enables this setting, the rest of these settings will be 
// propagated to other players that joins a game created by this host.
// Changing these values has no effect if you join another game. 
// Regardless of settings, there is always a minimum set of information 
// that is desync checked. But turning this off means you won't get generated logs.
// When a game desyncs, look in your logs folder for files starting with REPLAY
// To analyze a desync, you can get the logs from the other players and use 
// a diff program to see what's different.
// NOTE: Desync tracking is not available in Quickmatch.
// NOTE2: Desync tracking works while watching replays. This sometimes 
// can be useful to watch a replay after a desync with more logging turned
// on to generate extra information. 
// NOTE3: When you change this config file, you have to relaunch the game
// for the new settings to take effect.
DesyncTrackingEnabled=0


//Number of frames of history to keep track of. There are generally 30 frames 
//per second, but recommend keeping this above 100. When the game desyncs, a 
//message is sent and needs to be received by other players, this can take 
//some time. Also the bigger this is, the more memory will be required. 
DesyncTrackingFrameHistorySize=100


//The shipped game used to have this set to 128, which is roughly once per 4 seconds.
//The MemoryFrameHistory needs to be higher than this number to catch the desync 
//early enough in the history, but with extra to compensate for network packet 
//travel time. Having this set to 1 made the game much more susceptible to the disconnect
//desync.
CheckDesyncsEveryXFrames=1


//This acts like every category is turned on before a game actually starts. This can 
//track down problems as a result of a frame 1 desync. Such as the RMS script behaved
//differently between players, miscommunication of data, etc.
//BEWARE: On particularly large maps with lots of players, this data can exceed 100MB.
//But your log folders get deleted after 10 runs, so it won't fill up your harddrive. 
LogEverythingBetweenStartAndFirstFrame=0


//These categories represent different parts of the game, and the more you have 
//turned on, the slower the game will be and the more memory you will need to 
//store the history in memory. The idea is to know which categories to turn on
//depending on the type of desync you are experience.
//General gameplay desyncs: RandSync, PlayerSync, UnitSync, and GodPowersSync 
//Disconnect or vote desyncs: ResignSync, CommandSync, CommSync, ChecksumSync.
